              I've never had a traditional job. I became really good at online poker in high school, which had the fortunate benefit of making me money. By the time I graduated high school, I had earned over <Hoverable text="Not bad for a kid who saved up money to deposit $20 onto a poker site!">$100,000</Hoverable>. I went to college, where I made more than $1 million as a teenager, mostly in my dorm room between classes and basketball practice.

              After graduating college in <Hoverable text="with a degree in..uh..Political Economy? haha">2012</Hoverable>, I went <Hoverable text="ðŸ˜‰">all-in</Hoverable> on poker, dedicating over 100 hours per week to playing and studying. 
              I quickly became one of the best Pot Limit <Hoverable text="Omaha is the 2nd most popular poker variant behind Texas Hold'em. It's basically Hold'em, but you get dealt 4 cards and can only play 2 of them.">Omaha</Hoverable> players in the world. In 2014 I won a World Series of Poker <Hoverable text="This basically means I got lucky in one tournament, a feat far less impressive than being a regular winner in the biggest cash games on the internet. But alas, TV and glory and such means this is probably how I should headline my poker resumÃ©.">bracelet.</Hoverable>

              By 2015, I felt I'd accomplished what I set out to do in poker. Even though I still enjoyed the game and was winning at peak rates, 
              I was ready to move on. I found myself increasingly drawn to technology, and in particular to its enormous potential as a force for good.

              In 2017, I moved to San Francisco and completed <a href="https://www.galvanize.com/hack-reactor/" target="_blank">Hack Reactor</a>, sparking my love for computer science. Post-bootcamp, I teamed up with two friends to further our knowledge through textbooks, online courses, and <a href="https://bradfieldcs.com/" target="_blank">Bradfield</a> programs.</p>
              <p>Come 2019, we were on the hunt for a significant project. I scoured my network for opportunities to jump in the deepend. This led to a conversation with an old poker friend, who had switched to high-frequency trading, about his software needs. After assessing their $100 million+ wagering software, we concluded we could create something far better. Despite our limited project experience, I persuaded my friend to hire us. I was less than thrilled to be back in the gambling and finance arena, but the high-stakes challenge was a great opportunity for rapid skill-building.

            <p>A year later, we had the industry's top product and dominated our niche. Our end-to-end enterprise software solution delivered unparalleled performance. By early 2022, we had automated all we could, and I felt it was time for a new adventure.</p>
            <p>Since then, I've dabbled in various endeavors. I've taken on some engineering gigs in the gambling and finance sectors, leveraging my existing network. I've also partnered with a leading daily fantasy sports bettor to develop custom algorithms and streamline their workflow. My ongoing education in computer science continues via Bradfield's online platform, csprimer.com. Alongside these, I had to recover from a car accident earlier this year.</p>
            <p>
              Now, my focus is shifting toward mission-driven work. I'm selective about my next deep dive; 
              it needs to push boundaries and align with my values. I'm especially keen on working face-to-face. 
              For now, Neuralink stands out as a compelling option.
