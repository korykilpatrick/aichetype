    <p>
      Welcome to my personal website, where I share my thoughts on AI, tech, and helping others. Follow my journey as I explore
      cutting-edge technologies and share my experiences.

      Hey :wave: I'm Kory. I like solving problems, helping people, and pushing the bounds of understanding. I believe theres a psychic substrate of reality that is just a vibrant as the physical one. 

      In past lives I was one of the best poker players in the world, and more recently co-founder of a small B2B SaaS in niche high-frequency trading space.

      I invest in ambitious, missinon-driven startups. I self-study computer science and software engineering. I mentor high schoolers. I'm currently looking to join or start a team of like-minded individuals who are passionate about leveraging technology to solve the world's most pressing problems.
