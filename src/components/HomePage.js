      Hey ðŸ‘‹ I'm Kory. I like solving problems, helping people, and pushing the bounds of understanding. I believe theres a psychic substrate of reality that is just a vibrant as the physical one. I spend much of my time there, as well as thinking about how to use technology to solve the world's most pressing problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      In past lives I was one of the best poker players in the world, and more recently co-founder of a small B2B SaaS company in niche high-frequency trading space. I also have previously and continue to invest in ambitious, mission-driven startups.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm currently considering getting *gasp* my first job! I'm eager to start or join a team of like-minded individuals who are passionate about leveraging technology to solve the world's most pressing problems. Until then, I'll be self-studying computer science and software engineering and hacking around on random projects like this site.
