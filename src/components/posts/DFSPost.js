          <h2>NBA Shotluck</h2>

            An NBA betting expert friend came to me with an idea for a betting tool. He designed the algorithm and I implemented everything.

          <p>
            A game's score is a lossy signal for how well the teams are playing and how well one might expect them to play in the future. Most notably, it doesn't account for randomness inherent in shooting. For example, Steph Curry is a 42.8% 3pt shooter over his career. If he shoots a 3 on the first play of a game the score <em>in EV</em> <Hoverable text="Expected Value"></Hoverable> is now <Hoverable text="3*.428">1.28</Hoverable> - 0, but the <em>actual</em> score is either 3-0 or 0-0. 1.28 - 0 is a much more accurate representation of the teams' relative performance than 3-0 or 0-0, as it controls for shotluck. Access to high-fidelity luck-adjusted scores helps identify potentially mispriced lines.<Hoverable text="A simple example to illustrate the benefit of shotluck-adjusted scoring: The Warriors' first three possessions are wide open 3pt shots by a healthy Steph Curry. He misses them all. The Timberwolves first three possessions are wide open 3pt shots by Rudy Gobert, who has made 0 of his 14 attempted threes in his 11 year career. He makes 2 of the three. The Timberwolves are up 6-0. Who is playing better?"></Hoverable>

            There have been a number of betting related problems that I've used programming to solve, but that don't fit into a neat project. Being a professional bettor often means moving quickly in response to new information, so I am regularly scraping data of all sorts, building algorithms, automating work, and building tools to help my partners and I make better decisions, often in a race against the clock.
