              I've never had a traditional job. <a href="/poker">I became quite good at online poker</a> in high school, which had the fortunate side-effect of being lucrative. By the time I graduated high I earned over <Hoverable text="From an initial, and at the time lofty, $20 deposit">$100,000.</Hoverable> I went to college, where I made more than $1 million as a teenager, mostly in my dorm room between classes and basketball practice.

              After graduating in <Hoverable text="with a degree in..uh..Political Economy?" width="200px">2012,</Hoverable> I went <Hoverable text="ðŸ˜‰">all-in</Hoverable> on poker, dedicating virtually every waking moment to playing or studying. 
              I quickly became one of the best Pot Limit <Hoverable text="Omaha is the second most popular poker variant behind Texas Hold'em. It's basically Hold'em, but you get dealt 4 cards (instead of 2) and can only play 2 of them.">Omaha</Hoverable> players in the world. In 2014 I won a World Series of Poker bracelet.

              By 2015 I was ready to move on. I still enjoyed playing and was winning at peak rates, but I was increasingly not okay with the fact that I was spending all my time and energy on a zero-sum game. I spent some time traveling to poker stops around the world and volunteering. During this time, I found myself increasingly drawn to technology, and in particular to its enormous potential as a force for good.

              I moved to San Francisco in 2017 without knowing anyone there and with no plans other than to pursue tech. At the end of the year I completed <a href="https://www.galvanize.com/hack-reactor/" target="_blank">Hack Reactor</a>, which sparked my love for computer science. Post-bootcamp, two friends and I immersed ourselves in textbooks, online courses, and <Hoverable text="I can't speak highly enough of Bradfield, and it's founder  <a href='https://x.com/oznova_' target='_blank'>Oz</a>"><a href="https://bradfieldcs.com/" target="_blank">Bradfield</a></Hoverable> programs.

              <p>By the end of 2019 we were on the hunt for a significant project. I probed my network for opportunities to jump in the deepend. This led to a conversation with an old poker friend, who had pivoted to starting a business in a niche trading market, about his technology needs. After assessing the software his team used, the three of us concluded we could build something better. I was reluctant to be back in the finance world, but being able to leverage my network and reputation to gain access to a high-stakes, high-pressure arena was too promising of a skill-building opportunity to pass up.

            <p>Since then, I've dabbled in various endeavors while figuring out my next big move.
