              I've never had a traditional job. <Link to ="/poker" className="internal-link">I became quite good at online poker</Link> in high school, which had the fortunate side-effect of being lucrative. By the time I graduated high I earned over <Hoverable text="From an initial, and at the time lofty, $20 deposit">$100,000.</Hoverable> I went to college, where I made more than $1 million as a teenager, mostly in my dorm room between classes and basketball practice.

              After graduating in <Hoverable text="with a degree in..uh..Political Economy?" width="200px">2012,</Hoverable> I went <Hoverable text="ðŸ˜‰">all-in</Hoverable> on poker, dedicating virtually every waking moment to playing or studying. 
              I quickly became one of the best Pot Limit <Hoverable text="Omaha is the second most popular poker variant behind Texas Hold'em. It's basically Texas Hold'em, but you get dealt 4 cards (instead of 2) and can only play 2 of them.">Omaha</Hoverable> players in the world. In 2014 I won a World Series of Poker bracelet.

            <p>
              By 2015 I was ready to move on. I still enjoyed playing and was winning at peak rates, but I was increasingly not okay with the fact that I was spending all my time and energy on a zero-sum game. I spent some time traveling to poker stops around the world and volunteering in the area. During this time, I found myself increasingly drawn to technology, and in particular to its enormous potential as a force for good.

              I moved to San Francisco in 2017 without knowing anyone there and with no plans other than to pursue tech. I had always been interested in programming, and suspected it would be a natural transition from the kind of work I did in poker.<Hoverable text="ðŸŽ¯"></Hoverable> At the end of the year I completed <a href="https://www.galvanize.com/hack-reactor/" target="_blank">Hack Reactor</a>, which sparked my love for computer science. Post-bootcamp, two friends and I immersed ourselves in textbooks, online courses, and <Hoverable text="I can't speak highly enough of Bradfield, and it's founder  <a href='https://x.com/oznova_' target='_blank'>Oz</a>"><a href="https://bradfieldcs.com/" target="_blank">Bradfield</a></Hoverable> programs.

In addition to computer science I also got hooked on Catan during this period and became top 5 in the world on <a href='https://catanuniverse.com/en' target='_blank'>Catan Universe</a>." size={.75}/>
              <p>By the end of 2019 we were on the hunt for a significant project. I probed my network for opportunities to jump in the deepend. This led to a conversation with an old poker friend who had pivoted to starting a business in a niche trading market, about his technology needs. After assessing the software his team used, the three of us concluded we could build something better. I was reluctant to be back in the finance world, but being able to leverage my network and reputation to gain access to a high-stakes, high-pressure arena was too promising of a skill-building opportunity to pass up.
            </p>
            <p>A year later, we had the <Link to="/betterdata" className="internal-link">top product</Link> in our niche. Another year and the software was almost entirely <Hoverable text="It still irks me that we couldn't <em>fully</em> automate the software, but it often has to respond to unpredictably structured data while also being completely fault-intolerant so some human oversight is required. <em>sigh</em>. We did build some great tooling that makes maintenance as simple as possible though.">self-sustaining,</Hoverable> at which point I felt it was time to move on. I left the company, but Jordan and Matt are still doing well running it today.<Hoverable text="I feel incredibly fortunate to have had this experience with two of my best friends in the world."></Hoverable>
            </p>
            <p>Since then, I've dabbled in various endeavors while figuring out which deepend to jump into next. Most notably, <Link to="/sportsanalytics" className="internal-link">I've partnered with professional sports bettors</Link> to do data analytics, develop novel betting algorithms, and streamline their workflow. I've also done some angel investing, continued my CS <Hoverable text="Mostly via ChatGPT rabbitholes and Bradfield's new online platform <a href='https://csprimer.com' target='_blank'>CS Primer</a>.">education,</Hoverable> and been an active mentor on <a href="https://www.backrs.com/" target="_blank">Backrs</a>. I spent the first half of the year meeting with early stage founders, but I didn't find anything sufficiently <Hoverable text="I got close to joining a promising medtech startup as CTO, but they aren't Austin-based and I decided working in-person is non-negotiable for me right now.">compelling.</Hoverable>
            </p>
            <p>
              I've become too comfortable, which means it's time for a change. I quit poker because it wasn't fulfilling. I got into tech because I believe software is the great lever of our time. I built a company to uplevel my programming skills. Now I want to channel my skills, and learn new ones, toward a mission I'm excited and passionate about. And nothing is more exciting to me right now than the prospect of working with brilliant people on BCIs.
