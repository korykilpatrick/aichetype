              I've never had a traditional job. I became really good at online poker in high school, which had the fortunate benefit of making me money. By the time I graduated high school, I had earned over <Hoverable text="From an initial, and at the time lofty, $20 deposit">$100,000</Hoverable>. I went to college, where I made more than $1 million as a teenager, mostly in my dorm room between classes and basketball practice.

              After graduating college in <Hoverable text="with a degree in..uh..Political Economy?">2012</Hoverable>, I went <Hoverable text="ðŸ˜‰">all-in</Hoverable> on poker, dedicating virtually every waking moment to playing or studying. 
              I quickly became one of the best Pot Limit <Hoverable text="Omaha is the 2nd most popular poker variant behind Texas Hold'em. It's basically Hold'em, but you get dealt 4 cards (instead of 2) and can only play 2 of them.">Omaha</Hoverable> players in the world. In 2014 I won a World Series of Poker <Hoverable text="This basically means I got lucky in one tournament, a feat far less impressive than being a regular winner in the biggest cash games on the internet. But alas, TV and glory and such means this is probably how I should headline my poker resumÃ©.">bracelet.</Hoverable>
            </p>
            <p>
              By 2016 I was ready to move on. I still enjoyed playing and was winning at peak rates, but I was increasingly not okay with the fact that I was spending all my time and energy mastering a zero-sum game. I found myself increasingly drawn to technology, and in particular to its enormous potential as a force for good.

              In 2017, I moved to San Francisco and completed <a href="https://www.galvanize.com/hack-reactor/" target="_blank">Hack Reactor</a>, sparking my love for computer science. Post-bootcamp, two friends and I immersed ourselves in textbooks, online courses, and <Hoverable text="I can't speak highly enough of Bradfield, and it's founder <a href='https://x.com/oznova_' target='_blank'>Oz</a>."><a href="https://bradfieldcs.com/" target="_blank">Bradfield</a></Hoverable> programs.
              </p>
              <p>Come 2019, we were on the hunt for a significant project. I probed my network for opportunities to jump in the deepend. This led to a conversation with an old poker friend, who had switched to high-frequency trading, about his software needs. After assessing their $100 million+ wagering software, my friends and I concluded we could create something better. Despite our limited project experience, I persuaded my friend to hire us. I was less than thrilled to be back in the gambling/finance space, but the high-stakes arena was a great opportunity for rapid skill-building.
            </p>
            <p>A year later, we had the industry's top product and dominated our niche. Our end-to-end enterprise software solution delivered unparalleled performance in the industry. By early 2022, we had automated all we could, and I felt it was time for a new adventure. My friends bought me out and are still doing well with the business today.
            </p>
            <p>Since then, I've dabbled in various endeavors. I've taken on some more gambling/finance projects, working with my existing network. I've partnered with a leading daily fantasy sports bettor to develop custom algorithms and streamline their workflow. My ongoing education in computer science continues via Bradfield's new online platform, csprimer.com.

              Now, my focus is shifting toward mission-driven work. I'm selective about my next deep dive; 
              it needs to push boundaries and align with my values. I'm especially keen on working face-to-face. 
              For now, Neuralink stands out as a compelling option.
