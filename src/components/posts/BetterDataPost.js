            In late 2019 two friends and I began working on building software for a former colleague of mine who had built a business in a niche high-frequency trading space. It started with us merely tinkering, trying to see if we <em>could</em> build something better than what he was currently using. A year later we had a highly regarded, high-end product and a handful of high paying customers.

            I worked on this company for over 2 years alongside two friends, taking it from a blank document to a profitable business. I can't disclose much of the details, but I can outline the problem space and our solution at a high level.

          <h3>Problem ‚ùó</h3>
          <p>
            Our clients are small teams of traders that want to execute trades on a large number of exchanges concurrently. They need to be able to manage their data, execute trades, monitor their positions in real-time, analyze their performance, have perfect record-keeping, and more. The market is fast-moving and constantly changing, so they need highly performant, customizable, and adaptable software to be competitive.
