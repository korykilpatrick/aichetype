            In 2019 we were eager to find a large project to solidify and up-level our newfound skills. I scoured my network for ideas, and found an old poker friend who had pivoted into a niche high frequency trading company. We inquired about the software they used to place $100m+ in wagers a year, and ultimately determined we could build a much better version of it. Despite having done no more than coursework and mini-projects, I convinced my friend that he should enlist us to provide his software services. I wasnâ€™t thrilled to be back in the gambling/finance world, but it was a high stakes opportunity that would force us to skill-build quickly and get great experience, and I was eager to do just that.

            After a year we had the best product in the industry and had cornered this niche market. The product is an end to end enterprise software solution for this market that provides industry leading performance. By early 2022 we had implemented all the features we wanted to and automated away everything possible. I was ready to move on to what was next, and stepped away from the company. My partners still run it and it is still doing well.
