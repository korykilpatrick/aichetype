            In late 2019 two friends and I began working on building software for a colleague of mine who runs a business in a niche high-frequency trading space. It started with us merely tinkering, trying to see if we <em>could</em> build something better than what he was currently using. A year later we had a highly regarded, high-end product and a handful of high paying customers. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I worked on this company for over 2 years alongside two friends, taking it from a blank document to a profitable business. I was the point person for all business related things as well as client-acquisition and relationships. My partners and I split the engineering work, each having our fingerprints over pretty much every aspect of the codebase.

          <h3>Problem ‚ùó</h3>
          <p>
            Our clients are small teams of traders that want to execute wagers on a large number of API-less exchanges concurrently. Their requirements include but are not limited to:
            <ul>
              <li>Execute high volume of wagers</li>
              <li>Monitor positions in real time</li>
              <li>Analyze their performance</li>
              <li>Accounting support</li>
            </ul>
            The market is fast-moving and constantly changing, so they need highly performant, customizable, and adaptable software to be competitive.

            <li>Robust web interface for reporting, data management, accounting, etc.</li>
            <li>100% up-time</li>
            <li>Complete fault-intolerance<Hoverable text="Turns out clients don't like it when you wager tens of thousands of dollars on the opposite of what they ask you to!"></Hoverable></li>

          <h3>Solution ‚úÖ</h3>
          <h4>üï∏Ô∏è Website as graph</h4>
          <p>
            We model an exchange as a graph, with web pages representing nodes and http request data representing edges between nodes. This allows us to robustly and intelligently navigate websites.
          </p>
          <h4>‚öôÔ∏è Operations</h4>
          <p>
            We define an operation as a discrete sequence of operation nodes. An operation node can be a request <Hoverable text="meaning it takes us from one page to another">node</Hoverable> or a middleware <Hoverable text="meaning it performs a necessary function required before sending the next request, e.g. data validation">node.</Hoverable> Placing wagers is a client initiated operation, but we also have a number of automated operations that run on a schedule.
          </p>
          <h4>üåÜ Modeling the ecosystem</h4>
          <p> 
            As we accrued data on exchanges, we noticed many cross-exchange commonalities. Eventually we were able to reverse-engineer a high resolution model of the ecosystem. We built a system that could automatically cluster <Hoverable text="including ones we had never seen before">exchanges</Hoverable> and create links to the appropriate operations. This allowed us to quickly add support for new exchanges and quickly update as exchanges evolved.
          </p>

The database is highly normalized, which allows us to easily add support for new exchanges and quickly update as exchanges evolve." zoom={true} size={.5} />
          <h4>Tools used</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><Hoverable text="The software is very database intensive">MySQL</Hoverable></li>
              <li>Python<Hoverable text="The only dependencies used anywhere signficant are python's request module, BeautifulSoup, and Telegram's python API for our messenger interface"></Hoverable></li>
              <li>C#<Hoverable text="Website"></Hoverable></li>
              <li>Bash</li>

      </Row>
      <Row>
        <Col>
          <h3>Results üìà</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Hit all our targets</li>
            <li>$1 billion in wagers executed at an average wager of $X</li>
            <li>Achieved near complete automation<Hoverable text="It still irks me that we couldn't <em>fully</em> automate the software, but it often has to respond to unpredictably structured data while also being completely fault-intolerant so some human oversight is required. <em>sigh</em>.
