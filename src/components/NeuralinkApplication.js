                <li>I figured out how to make a living playing online <Link to='/poker' className='internal-link'>poker</Link> when nobody thought it was possible. Discovering and defining the landscape was a huge and enjoyable part of that quest.</li>
                <li>Despite having no significant prior experience, I convinced a colleague to hire two friends and I to develop a <Link to='/betterdata' className='internal-link'>software product</Link> for his trading company that executes $100 million per year in wagers. Within a year we had the top product in our niche.</li>

                <ul>
                  <li>When starting <Link to="/betterdata" className='internal-link'>Better Data</Link>, each day that we could not traffic an exchange directly and explicitly translated to dollars lost out of our client's <Hoverable text="and, consequently, ours">pockets.</Hoverable> We had to get <em>something</em> up immediately. We did, and made the necessary rewrites when time permitted.</li>
                  <li>To survive in the gambling world you have to be extremely comfortable with moving forward in the face of uncertainty and with incomplete information. If you wait to have a perfect gameplan to get in a game there will be no openings left or the bad players will have already lost all their money.</li>
                  <li>This website! This is not the cleanest <a href="https://github.com/korykilpatrick/aichetype" target="_blank">code</a> or writing.

Web development is not my strength. Correctly positioning and sizing this damn box got the best of me one day, before I eventually reminded myself that it didn't need to be perfect and settled for the hacky implementation of hardcoding the box width to 400px if the box content has <30 characters."></Hoverable></li>

              <p>
                I grew up with parents who ran 4 am paper routes and worked multiple jobs to feed and care for my siblings and I, which instilled in me humility and resourcefulness. I've gotten burned by not handling the small stuff enough times to appreciate how important every detail is.
