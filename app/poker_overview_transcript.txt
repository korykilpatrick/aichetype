In 2003, a guy named Chris Moneymaker became famous for winning the World Series of Poker. He was just an accountant from Tennessee, a random guy that kind of sent shockwaves through the world that anyone could do this. I was a teenager, I was 14 years old, and I saw this on ESPN, and some friends and I thought that we would try to play poker and see how it went. So I saved up birthday money, cut yards, and scrounged together dollars I could to go play $10 buy-ins on the weekend with friends. This went on for a couple years, and I really loved playing. We all got really excited to play, played many weekends. And then when I was 17, a couple years later, I found out that you could play poker online. And at first I was like, that doesn't really make sense. Poker is about looking into each other's faces and telling if they're bluffing or not. But I loved poker, and I loved the idea of having that happen. So I looked into it, I downloaded, actually I don't remember what my first computer was, but I got an extremely cheap family computer and downloaded some poker software on it. Downloaded Bodog was the name of the poker software, where some of my friends said that you could play online. Actually, that's not right. The first poker site I played was with a friend on a site called Bugsy something. I don't remember what it was, but it wasn't for money, it was free, and that was my first taste of online poker. Shortly after I found out you could play for money and I started, I downloaded it and got really into it and started playing Bodog. When I was 17, I managed to get through their really intense security that said you must click a box. Actually no, first I had my older brother make an account, because at the time I was unaware that all you had to do to circumvent their tight security was check a box that says you're 18 or older, and I was only 17. It became, around that same time, I found a forum called pocketfives.com and my introduction to that site, then shortly after led me to 2plus2.com and I had a whole world open up. Prior to this, I thought that I was going to be a professional athlete, but this was when I was a junior in high school and my dreams of being a professional athlete were starting to come to a close. The reality that I wasn't going to be good enough to be a professional athlete was starting to set in and poker slipped right into that void. I started reading these forums, reading about all these people, many of them who were teenagers as well, who were trying to figure out this game and all the money that they were making. I just had to know, I was obsessed, I was hooked, I had to know what they were doing. I started, I found every book I could on poker, I'd sit in the back of my classes at my high school and read poker books under my desk. I would come home and open up the forums and start reading everything I could, finding every resource I could, playing as much as I could. I'd stay up until 2am on school nights playing as a junior in high school. One day, as a junior, I had my first big break where I played a $5 tournament and was up all night making the final table and ultimately I ended up getting second place in it for I think like $500 or something like that which was an astronomical amount of money for me at the time. I remember I left a napkin, I wrote on a napkin that I wouldn't be down for breakfast, sorry I said this on a napkin at the end of the tournament, I was furious that I got second place, that I didn't get first place, I just wanted to win so badly, I didn't even care about the money, I just wanted to get first place and I was so mad that I didn't get first place and I was so determined that right when it ended, in a fit of fury, I pulled out a napkin and wrote down, not going to be down for breakfast, was up all night getting second place in a poker tournament, I'm going to be the best poker player in the world one day and I put it in the kitchen for my parents to see when they woke up and I meant it with every bone in my body and then I just started playing around the clock and studying, giving it absolutely everything I had for the next eight or nine years. As a junior in high school, I made around $50,000 playing tournaments and sit and goes. By the time I graduated high school, in the summer after my high school year, I ascended the pocket fives tournament rankings to become a top 25 player in the world, a metric that is completely ridiculous but somewhat, but felt really good at the time. I went to college and I played basketball in college and did the bare minimum to skate by in classes because all I was doing was playing basketball and playing and studying poker because when I got to college, my basketball in school schedule was pretty demanding. I didn't have the luxury of devoting eight hours to a poker tournament or whatever was needed at any time, so I learned cash games and I started to look into what cash games I should play. There's lots of different games, not just Texas Hold'em, but at that point I had only played Texas Hold'em and the game Potlum, Omaha was the second biggest game besides Hold'em. I had a friend who was doing really well at it at the time and everybody's attention was on Mill and the Hold'em and I decided that the smart move would be to kind of go where all the attention and popularity was not, but where there was still tons of action and tons of potential to make money in a really popular and growing game. So I devoted, I pivoted, I still played tournaments on the rare occasions that I could, but I pivoted to studying Potlum and Omaha cash games around the clock and giving it absolutely everything I had and I pretty quickly found success. At that point, I had made a fair bit of money from playing poker tournaments over the past few years, so I had a good bankroll to start and I started playing 2-4 or 1-2, 6-max Omaha cash games and I pretty quickly climbed the ranks and probably within a year I was playing 25-50 on Poker Stars in full tilt, games that I was almost certainly not winning in, but I was just so, I just wanted so bad to be playing against the best players and I knew that being in those games, even if I was not winning in them, it was an investment in my future and that I was going to be, by being in those games and playing against those players who were some of the best in the world, I was going to be sponging up absolutely everything and learning at a rate that would justify the payoff. So I played, the swings in Potlum and Omaha are outrageous, the variance is unreal, so it was pretty wild, I still played tournaments and had success, I won a few online poker series titles and by my sophomore year of college, I was playing the highest stakes Potlum and Omaha games on the internet, 10-20,000 buy-ins, culminating in the end of my sophomore year. sophomore year of college, I ended up playing $150, $450, $45,000 buying game for over a series of months with a trust fund baby, but that's a story for another time. In that, I lost over a million dollars over the course of three months, which was very painful and led to a very tough situation that I will write about another time, but I learned one thing that I always made sure was that I was either winning or I was learning and that taught me a great deal and was a really important experience for me and really made me grow up. And then after that, I became much more wise with my money. I went from playing $150, $450, the highest stakes games on the internet to found myself in the middle of my first semester of my junior year, unable to afford tuition or pay my bills. And so I went back down to playing $0.50 a dollar anyways, actually exclude this part from the post. I need to write about that in a separate post. So I became regular in the highest stakes poker games. When I graduated college, I thought very deeply about what I wanted to do next. On one hand, it was clear I was high up in the poker world. I could make a run at trying to be king of the hill and just making as much money as I could. But I always really knew that poker wasn't for me long term, even from the, even despite all the, how enamored I was by it and my desire to be the best, I knew from the time I started that I wanted, this was just a means to an end for me that I wanted to focus more on something that was more mission oriented and poker was not that. I decided after college that my best benefit in the world would be to use these skills to make as much money as I could and then donate it, earn to give as they called it. So I poured myself into poker. I had, you know, now with no college, no basketball, no school, I had all of my life to give. This is 2013 and I gave it all. I found a new tool called Omaha Ranger that was one of the first, it's kind of funny in the lineage of all the great poker AI tools, this is one of the first, like, I don't know, actually, I don't even, I don't know if you'd call it an AI tool, but it was a tool where you could do really kind of complex data analysis and study and I used that and my database of hand histories that I accrued to go through. My process would be to play in a session for an hour or two, mark hands on my database to review as I played them and then what's been, you know, at least that much time going back, reviewing, studying, using Omaha Ranger and other tools like it to kind of figure out, kind of analyze my play and then come up with optimal strategies and iterate and improve and also, you know, there's, I watched all the poker training content, read the forums, all of it. I was spending at least as much time, probably more time studying than playing, playing the biggest Omaha cash games in the world online and then traveling periodically to play the live tournaments and it went quite well. I started, I became really good, I became a solid winner in the biggest games on the internet. There's a couple of sites where I think I'm probably one of the all-time winningest players on the sites. I deployed a mixed strategy of playing the toughest games, which at the time were on poker stars and to sharpen my skills against the best opponents in the world and also I was winning in the game, but then what was even juicier was casting a wide net on all of the other random sites that had random players who were really bad that would come and play high stakes and just cast my way as right, as wide as possible and trying to scoop up some softer games. So I did really, really well in that. In 2014, I was going out to Vegas in the summers throughout my 20s for the World Series of Poker and I played a number of World Series events, which was kind of for fun and social reasons and they were profitable, but you know my playing online Omaha cash games was always my bread and butter and my highest hourly. But I went in 2014 and I won a bracelet in No Limit Hold'em actually. It was kind of ironic that I probably have more of a profile in No Limit Hold'em than probably in Omaha even though I'm quite good at No Limit Hold'em tournaments, but nowhere near the best and in Omaha I was one of the best Omaha players in the world and it's the second most popular variant of poker behind Texas Hold'em. So I went out, I won a bracelet, which was great for resume purposes more than anything and then the following year after it, I played, I continued to play the toughest, biggest cash games online. I had a year where I ran over a million dollars below expectation. Every single day I just busted my ass, played as hard as I could, played great, that my database, all the statistics were telling me that I was winning and I just could not win a hand and I had a realization that even though that happened for a year, I was not guaranteed for that to just turn around. I realized that math didn't owe me anything, that even though I showed up every day and did everything right and lost for a year straight, that there was no guarantee that I would just recover from this and so I sat down and decided that I had achieved what I wanted to, that there's no really, there's not really any way to determine. If you ask people today who the best poker player of all time is, they can't, you'll get a bunch of different answers and even in specific games, there's just too much ambiguity, there's too much variance, there's no way to get a large enough sample size to overcome the extreme variance in it. You can, I think there are basically tiers that you can put people in and then you can kind of have subjective opinions beyond that but I mean and then obviously another shortcoming you face is that people's actual results are always private and so you can think somebody's really good but unless you actually get all of the data of all the hands played and compare them side by side, you can't really know and people don't really leak that data. So I made the choice that I needed to move on, it had been kind of, it wasn't an abrupt choice, it was a fundamental choice that poker was great for me and I was very grateful for everything but the combination of the amount of variance and the kind of emotional toll that it takes to go through extended downswings and also the reality of the variance meaning that I wouldn't be able to kind of, actually no, skip that part. And then really just at this point I was in my mid-twenties and knew that I was still young enough and I had enough energy that I could set off on like my kind of life's work and that I knew poker was not my life's work. So after that I still continued to play periodically but I've, and I still even play occasionally but that's kind of the end of my poker story.
