In 2022, I followed up on a request that a colleague of mine from that I've known for a long time from poker made of me to work with him to write some code to enhance his daily fantasy sports betting algorithm and workflow. He is one of the all-time winningest daily fantasy sports players and has been around since its inception, and he felt that there was space for software to be built that could improve everything he did. In 2022, I took him up on it and decided that I started working with him. The basic situation was him and his team just did a lot of stuff in Google Sheets. They had a lot of ideas for how to use data that they had at their disposal to come up with novel algorithms for their betting strategies. My role was to use my game theory expertise alongside of theirs to help come up with algorithms, and then I had full responsibility for actually implementing the algorithms and providing a user interface for them to work with the data and results from the algorithms. It ended up being kind of all over the place. The demands of the job were that you had to be incredibly flexible because daily fantasy sports is still relatively new, and also the kind of parameters, not just the parameters that you're working with, but also just the kinds of techniques that you have to deploy can vary week to week. And sometimes even contest to contest, intraday variations. So I had to be very nimble and just ready to kind of move like water with the ecosystem, and being able to rapidly iterate and develop new algorithms was a core component of it. It mostly entailed taking in player projections and data as inputs and then coming up with novel techniques and strategies for the various contests that we would come up with. It was really just kind of everything sports data was on the table and needed to be prepared to be worked with. There was a lot of historical looking back and kind of post-game analysis. It was really just like deep data dives and data science stuff, or just like programmatic execution of game theory algorithms. My partners that I worked with provided domain expertise. They did a lot of research on, so we only did this for the NFL, they did a lot of research on the NFL in particular and NFL players so that they had all the appropriate context there. And then they're also game theory experts, people that I've worked with for a long time in the game theory world. And so basically they provided the domain expertise, we collaborated on the game theory component, and I provided all of the software engineering, which was a heavy portion of it. Most of what we were doing was collaborating to develop novel algorithms and then having the algorithms output our strategies and just inserting the outputted strategies into these contests and deciding where to deploy our investments.
