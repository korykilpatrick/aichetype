We're going to talk about Mac Miller here. So I am finishing the Dissect podcast on Mac Miller's album, Swimming in Circles. And the guy is a genius. He's about my age and I remember listening to him in college and loving when his first album came out. I kind of only, I was not aware of how big, how genius he was until recently. The Dissect podcast is incredible. I've listened to Kanye West seasons on there and I listened to Childish Gambino's Because the Internet, which were fantastic and examples of just absolutely magnificent and creative and ingenious storytelling. And I think Mac Miller fits right in with those albums on that level of just beautiful storytelling. But the difference is that Kanye and Donald Glover, they tell stories that are related to their life, but more mythical in nature. They're fiction stories. They're metaphors about experience and like character development about like made up characters that are probably loosely related to their life. Meanwhile, Mac Miller is just out here wrapping his experience. He's quoted in an interview as saying that he tells people when they ask how he's doing to listen to his songs, like his life is just embedded in his music. And that's like indicative of a principle that I find really admirable about him is that he is so immersed in the moment and in himself and he just loses himself in his work. And he's so raw and vulnerable and authentic and he is just unabashedly himself, warts and all. He raps about addiction. He struggled for his whole adult life and ultimately died of overdose. He struggled with addiction his whole adult life. And he is just a lot of the album Swimming is just metaphors of him trying to find his way through his addiction and these really beautiful painted metaphors about being in a relationship, his relationship to his fans and to himself. And talking about the struggle of trying to find peace of mind, sober, but ultimately the pool of addiction just like thrashing him around and hurting himself and those around him. But just being so raw and honest about why he does it and how relieving it is for him to get high and how challenging it is to resist it. And even times where he endorses it or he's just like, yeah, I'm just going to get high. It's like he gives voice to all of the parts of him, not only gives voice, but he puts all of the parts of him on display for the entire world and his millions and millions of fans to listen to. It is like the most raw and vulnerable thing. And I just really, really admire it and want to like take that in from consuming his music and this dissect season more than anything else. He was a pure soul. He was a fallible human like the rest of us, an amazingly gifted artist. And another thing that I admire is that he knew that his voice was his vehicle of change in the world. He wanted to be a positive influence. He wanted to leave a mark and he knew that his voice was it. And so he used it and he was prolific. He always turned to music. He lost himself in his music and just the commitment, the like recognition, the ability to like answer the call to action and like tap into himself enough to know his like kind of divine purpose is just really, really stunning and admirable. That's just something I keep coming back to. He reminds me of Marc-Andr√© Lacroix, who is just so unabashedly authentic and committed to being themselves and owning their experience regardless of the consequences and just showing up and being ruthlessly present moment to moment in life. They just engage with the world on a plane that is so breath, so refreshing and admirable and I want to be more like them.
