A quick professional overview for me, I started playing poker and having a lot of success online when I was in high school. When I graduated college, I went all in on becoming as good as I can at that and basically devoted around a decade towards ascending the poker ranks. After that, I quit because I had achieved everything I wanted to and I wanted to do more meaningful work. I moved to San Francisco and did a coding boot camp and then took a bunch of online courses of various kinds and essentially taught myself to code. Then two years with my head buried in textbooks and online courses, I was wanting to find a project to dive head first into because I've learned the best way to learn something is to jump into the deep end. I had some connections from poker who had pivoted into this niche trading market. I was talking to them one day, asked about the software that they use, it's a very software intensive project, and decided that two buddies and I, who we had all taken the online courses and learned programming together, we would set out to build a better version of the product that they use to place hundreds of millions of dollars in wagers. That turned into a business. We spent two years just doing that. I wasn't interested in the domain whatsoever, but it was a nice segue, it was an opportunity that I was able to leverage connections and the reputation that I built to get an opportunity to have my engineering skills put to the test. I learned a ton about engineering. After a year, we monopolized this little niche market, and I essentially lost any kind of interest and was ready to move on and start using my skills that I acquired to do more meaningful work. That was early 2022, and then since then, I've been exploring what's next. I do various projects still on the finance front. I'm an angel investor. I also have a good friend also from the poker world, a longtime colleague who is one of the best daily fantasy sports bettors, and I worked with him last year to build some proprietary software for him for daily fantasy sports and have bet a lot with him on that, which was just another opportunity for me to enter a high-stakes arena to challenge and level up my programming skills. I've explored various opportunities in entrepreneurship and ultimately decided that what my next step is going to be is going to be I want a pure pivot. I did the poker thing for a while, and then I did an in-between where I was still in kind of the finance and gambling realm, but I was on the engineering side of it, and now I want to pivot completely out of the finance and engineering realm and into something more meaningful. I've studied the brain in various capacities, recreationally and somewhat professionally, for my entire life, and Neuralink is the most fascinating company in the world to me. The prospect of being able to use any kind of skills that I've acquired in my life to potentially answer questions, solve mysteries of the brain, and more importantly, generate concrete substantial impacts, positive impacts on people's lives is absolutely riveting to me, and I hope that's where I land next.
